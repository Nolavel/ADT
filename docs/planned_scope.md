# Planned scope — not started

Everything on this page is **not implemented**. It exists here so that it
does not exist in the file tree as an empty script or an empty directory.

An `extends Node` placeholder and an empty folder both read to a newcomer as
either committed scope or abandoned work. Neither is true. This list is the
honest version.

Nothing here is a commitment. Items are built only when an existing system
demonstrably cannot carry the weight, and only when the item serves at least
two systems that already exist.

## Removed from the tree on 2026-07-29

These files were `extends Node` and nothing else. Deleting them does not
delete the intent — it is recorded below.

### Transport

| Was | Intent | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|
| `core/controllers/transport/base/lift_base.gd` | Vertical lift between strata | A location where a lift is required by gameplay |
| `core/controllers/transport/base/tube_transit_base.gd` | Pneumatic tube transit; observer camera only | `TUBE_TRANSIT` mode has a destination worth travelling to |
| `core/controllers/transport/base/hover_metro_base.gd` | Levitating metro line, distinct from tubes | Hover base proven at scale first |
| `core/controllers/transport/metro_train_types/train0..3.gd` | Metro rolling stock variants | Metro base exists |
| `core/controllers/transport/hover_types/hover_bus.gd`, `hover_van.gd`, `hover_truck.gd` | Hover variants beyond the player car | A reason for a second hover type; one is enough for streaming stress-testing |
| `core/controllers/transport/ai_hover_controller.gd` | AI driver feeding the same `set_move_intent()` interface as the player controller | Traffic is needed; the interface on `HoverBase` already anticipates it |

Duplicate empty stubs of `input_hover_controller.gd` and
`ai_hover_controller.gd` also existed at
`core/controllers/transport/`. The working implementation lives at
`core/controllers/transport/base/input_hover_controller.gd`. The duplicates
were removed; they were never referenced.

### Systems

| Was | Intent | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|
| `core/sound/sound_systems.gd` | Audio bus routing, diegetic sources, ambience per stratum | A deliberate audio design pass; this is a clean seam and a good delegation target |
| `core/world/world_environment_systems/world_environment_systems.gd` | Environment aggregation | Unclear that it is needed at all — `environment_lighting_system.gd` currently covers the ground it was created for |

### Player components

The following directories under `player/player_components/` were empty:
`attributes`, `crafting`, `equipment`, `health`, `hunger`, `progression`,
`save_player`, `sleep`, `wallet`.

Implemented components — `nav_component`, `stamina_component`,
`interact_component` — are unaffected.

| Intent | Note |
|---|---|
| Health | Needed once damage exists. Damage does not exist. |
| Hunger, sleep | Physiology. Deliberately not surfaced as permanent on-screen bars; state is shown at threshold crossings, on request, or when it blocks an action. |
| Wallet, progression | Economy is tied to identity, which is a core theme rather than a numbers system. Design not settled. |
| Equipment, crafting | Not designed. The `crafting` input action exists but is unbound and unread — see below. |
| Save | **This is the gap that matters.** Saving is a load-bearing system and the only one not started. It cannot be delegated (it touches everything) and gets more expensive with every system added. |

## Input actions defined but not implemented

Present in `project.godot`, read by nothing:

- `crouch` — bound to `C` / `Ctrl`, unread
- `weapon_reload` — bound to `R`, unread (no weapons)
- `debug_info` — bound to `Enter`, unread
- `crafting` — **no binding at all and unread**

They are documented in `input_map.md` as reserved. They are kept because
removing and re-adding an action churns `project.godot`; if they are still
unread at the next review, they go.

## Known conflict

`toggle_tabs` and `lock_on` are both bound to `Tab`, and both are on-foot
actions. This is an unresolved collision, not a design decision.

---

## Not started, not stubbed

Named here so the absence is deliberate rather than overlooked:

- **NPC and AI.** Does not exist in any form. The design documents rest
  heavily on how the city reacts to the player; none of that reaction is
  built. Largest gap between design and code in the project.
- **Combat.** The camera has a lock-on sub-state; there is nothing to lock
  onto and nothing to fight.
- **Missions.**
- **Animation beyond the player's own state machine**, which currently lives
  directly in `player/player.gd`.
